"The function f(x) to be integrated is called the integrand.
The function we are integrating must be non-negative continuous function between lower bound and upper bound
Non-negative function: is a function when it attain non negative values only. A function would be called a
positive function if its values are positive for all arguments of its domain, or a non-negative function
if all of its values are non-negative. The function graph sits above or on the x-axis.
Continuous function: is a function with no holes, jumps or vertical asymptotes
(where the function heads up/down towards infinity). A vertical asymptote between lower bound and
upper bound affects the definite integral."
